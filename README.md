# Game-Avoid
This is a simple game created in android studio with java programming language.
This game is endless. The character can move left to right to avoid objects. Once it is in the third collision with an object the game stops and returns to the home page. The home page has three buttons of which you can set the difficulty of the game, you can see the highest score obtained and you can start the game again.
